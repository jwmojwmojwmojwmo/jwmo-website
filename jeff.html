        <h2>A Brief History</h2>
        <p> In my second year at UBC, I took CPSC213 with my GOAT Jordan Johnson. This was my first class that delved
            into low-level computing architecture.
            I really don't know how to describe everything we did, so to quote the UBC Academic Calendar:
            "Software architecture, operating systems, and I/O architectures. Relationships between application
            software, operating systems,
            and computing hardware; critical sections, deadlock avoidance, and performance; principles and operation of
            disks and networks."</p>
        <p> Most people found the course hard. I thought it was on the difficult side, but I never really found it that
            hard.
            But that was probably because I found the course content so interesting. So interesting, that in the final
            month of the course, I decided to try to write my own machine code/assembly language.
            The name SupremeASM means nothing, I really just picked the first word that sounded cool.</p>
        <p> At first I started off small. I modelled a basic CPU and Memory implementation, and got to work on some very
            basic, machine code instructions.
            These included loading immediate values, storing values to memory, and printing values. </p>

                prints them out one by one in the right order.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>Technical Information</h2>
        <p>My apologies if you only care about the technical stuff and you had to scroll through all my rambling just to
            get here. But anyways here we go.</p>
        <p> First things first, if you want to learn how to use this language, or how to make libraries, or etc., read
            the README.md in the GitHub repo. I ain't rewriting allat. &lt;3</p>
        <h3>The Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            At its core, the system runs a custom <strong>32-bit Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)</strong> with 10
            general-purpose registers and a dedicated hardware Stack Pointer.
            Unlike basic interpreters that read text commands, SupremeASM simulates a true
            <strong>Fetch-Decode-Execute</strong> cycle.
            It decodes raw binary instructions using Bitwise Manipulation to isolate opcodes and operands, sorta kinda
            like how a physical CPU processes electrical signals.
