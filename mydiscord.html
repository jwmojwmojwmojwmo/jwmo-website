        <p>So uh, didn't expect to see you here.<br><br>Turns out Discord doesn't have a clean link like all these other sites do so you're here now. Sorry about that.</p>
        <p><br><br><br>Anyways if you're here you might as well friend me on Discord eh? Again Discord doesn't have a nice link to my profile so ig you'll jsut have to settle with this little page thing I did. Hope to see you on my friends list (I need more friends)</p>
        <p>Lowkey this is kinda awkward idk why I made this page. Anyways yeah my handle is jwmo friend me on discord tank you bye bai</p>
        <p> <br> Handle: jwmo</p>
        <p> <br><br><br>P.S. I was too lazy to actually format this website since nobody's finding it anyways so yeah that's why the button is there. if you look in the html i just added a bunch of page breaks so the background reaches all the way to the end i'm wayyy too lazy to css this</p>
