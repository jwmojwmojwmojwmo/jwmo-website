        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Online I'm known as <strong>jwmo</strong>. That's pretty unpronouncable to be honest, so you can just call me <strong>Jason</strong>.
        <p>Currently, I'm a Bachelor's of Science student at UBC, pursuing a Major in Computer Science, Minor in Data Science, and a Master's of Management through UBC's B+MM Dual Degree program.</p>
        <p>I spend most of my time building things that probably shouldn't exist. For example, I've been working on SupremeASM (my own custom assembly language), a Jeff the Landshark Discord bot, and trying to figure out how to make cool websites.
            Notice the subtle background colours that are my logo but are slowly changing into different colour palettes? Yeah that took me way too long.</p>
        <p>Although I love coding, HTML & CSS simply does not speak to me sometimes. I am not the graphics design man we need in society. Most of the time I enjoy backend more, but that doesn't mean I can't make websites!</p>

    <div id="my-stuff">
        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>Like I said I make things that probably shouldn't exist. But here's some projects I'm particularly proud of:</p>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="card">
                <h3 id="sasm-card">SupremeASM</h3>
                <p>A custom assembly language built in Java. Fully Turing-complete, and comes with a custom IDE to use it with. There's no reason for it to exist, but it does.</p>

                <h3 id="jeff-card">Jeff Discord Bot</h3>
                <p>The Jeff the Landshark Discord Bot made with Node.js. Get pictures of Jeff, rank your Marvel Rivals Jeff gameplay, and more. I love the little guy and you should too.</p>
